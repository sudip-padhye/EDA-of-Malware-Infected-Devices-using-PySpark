# Exploratory Data Analysis of Malware infected devices using PySpark

This project performs EDA on the Microsoft data containing details of Malware infected devices. For this, we make use of SparkSQL using PySpark library.

## Requirements

1. Kaggle account
   - https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data
   - In order to access data files
2. Install pyspark library

> pip install pyspark

## Analysis Performed

1. We try to find infected class-wise data distribution.

## Conclusion

The dataset has an equal count of both classes (malware-infected and non-infected devices). Moreover, it is observed that the devices running Windows10 are more vulnerable to malware, especially touch-enabled devices. The devices with App version 4.18.1807.18075 is at high risk as most of the affected systems have this version. 

From the analysis, we can also observe that the devices having more than 2 antivirus products installed are less affected. However surprisingly, the devices with no antivirus are also least affected. Also, 64-bit devices are largely affected and that too whose OS is genuine.
